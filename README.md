**Deep Learning Homework: Charity Funding Predictor**

Background
The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup aims to develop an algorithm that can predict the success of applicants for funding. Utilizing machine learning and neural networks, you will create a binary classifier that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

You have been provided with a CSV file containing over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. This dataset includes various columns capturing metadata about each organization, such as:

$$
EIN and NAME—Identification columns

APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type

AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry

CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification

USE_CASE—Use case for funding

ORGANIZATION—Organization type

STATUS—Active status

INCOME_AMT—Income classification

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application

ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

$$

Instructions

Step 1: Preprocess the Data

Using Pandas and Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler(), preprocess the dataset to prepare for compiling, training, and evaluating the neural network model in Step 2.

Read in the Data:

Load the charity_data.csv into a Pandas DataFrame.
Identify Targets and Features:

Target variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL
Feature variables: All other columns except EIN and NAME
Drop Unnecessary Columns:

Remove the EIN and NAME columns from the DataFrame.
Analyze Unique Values:

Determine the number of unique values for each column.
For columns with more than 10 unique values, identify the number of data points for each unique value.
Bin Rare Categorical Variables:

Use the count data to pick a cutoff point for binning rare categorical variables into a new value, Other.
Check if the binning was successful.
Encode Categorical Variables:

Use pd.get_dummies() to perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables.
Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

Design a neural network using TensorFlow Keras to create a binary classification model that predicts the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations.

Model Design:

Assign the number of input features and nodes for each layer.
Create the first hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.
If necessary, add a second hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.
Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.
Check the structure of the model.
Compile and Train:

Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train the model using the training data.
Save Model Weights:

Create a callback to save the model's weights every 5 epochs.
Evaluate the Model:

Evaluate the model using test data to determine the loss and accuracy.
Save Results:

Save and export the results to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.
Step 3: Optimize the Model

Optimize the model to achieve a target accuracy higher than 75%. If the target accuracy is not achieved, make at least three attempts to optimize the model.

Optimize Input Data:

Drop more or fewer columns.
Create more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
Adjust the number of values for each bin.
Adjust Model Parameters:

Add more neurons to hidden layers.
Add more hidden layers.
Use different activation functions for hidden layers.
Adjust the number of epochs.
Save Optimized Model:

Save and export the optimized model results to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5.
Step 4: Write a Report

Write a report on the performance of the deep learning model created for Alphabet Soup.

Overview of the Analysis:

Explain the purpose of the analysis.
Results:

Data Preprocessing:
Identify the target and feature variables.
Identify variables that should be removed from the input data.
Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation:
Describe the number of neurons, layers, and activation functions selected for the model.
Indicate whether the target model performance was achieved.
Outline steps taken to increase model performance.
Summary:

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model.
Provide recommendations on how a different model could solve the classification problem, explaining the rationale behind the recommendation.
By following these steps, you will create a well-documented analysis of the Charity Funding Predictor, including the preprocessing, modeling, optimization, and evaluation processes.
